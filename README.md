# Prank-Virus
\*DISCLAIMER\* This is not real malware \*DISCLAIMER\*\n
This prank works best if the person you're pranking has show file extensions disabled and is generally more of an amateur computer user.
The reasoning for that is because if they have it enabled it will show the .vbs extension.
The prank is fairly belivable because of the .vbs default icon (looks like a piece of paper with writing).
Change the essay.vbs to whatever u want the person to think it is, though make it something that would be a text file.
Let them run it.
Enjoy.
